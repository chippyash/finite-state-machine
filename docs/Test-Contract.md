# Chippyash Finite State Machine

## Chippyash\StateMachine\Events\EventableStateGraph

*  ✓ A stategraph can listen for psr 14 events
*  ✓ Errors from transitioning via an event will stop propagation for the event
*  ✓ The listener only listens for transition events
*  ✓ You can set a psr 14 event dispatcher on the stategraph
*  ✓ The event listener will trigger transition events
*  ✓ Pre transition events can stop a transition from occurring

## Chippyash\StateMachine\StateGraph

*  ✓ You can retrieve a stategraph name and description
*  ✓ A stategraph implements the describable interface
*  ✓ You can create a stategraph
*  ✓ Adding duplicate states will throw an exception
*  ✓ Adding duplicate transitions will throw an exception
*  ✓ Adding transitions for non existent from state will throw an exception
*  ✓ Adding transitions for non existent to state will throw an exception
*  ✓ You can retrieve possible transitions for a state
*  ✓ You can test if state is an initial state
*  ✓ You can test if state is a final state
*  ✓ You can retrieve the initial states
*  ✓ An exception willbe thrown if there are no initial states to be retrieved
*  ✓ You can validate a stategraph
*  ✓ A stategraph is invalid if it has no transitions
*  ✓ A stategraph is invalid if it has no initial transition
*  ✓ You can retrieve a clone of the composited graph object
*  ✓ Adding a state with a description will add a label to the graph vertex
*  ✓ Adding a transition with a description will add a label to the graph edge
*  ✓ You can get the next state for a transition
*  ✓ You can retrieve all transitions
*  ✓ You can retrieve all states
*  ✓ A state graph supports proxy method calls to the underlying graph object
*  ✓ An exception is thrown for an unknown proxy method
*  ✓ You can transition an object state with a stategraph
*  ✓ You cannot transition an object from an unknown state
*  ✓ You cannot transition an object with an unknown transition
*  ✓ You cannot transition an object if the transition does not apply to the current object state
